# Bookmarks API
Simple CRUD api with authentication and authorization to help me learn NestJS and backend development in general.

## Tech Stack
- NestJS
- Prisma
- Postgres

## Features
- Create, read, update, delete bookmarks
- Create users and edit user information
- Authenticates users and issues jwt access token

## How to use
To run the project loccally you need to have node installed and a database setup. I don't know much about setting up databases, I used Postgres for this project and Prisma is configured for postgres so if you want to use a different database make sure you update the schema.prisma file. I connected the database to the project using a .env file and had a variable called DATABASE_URL which is the url to the database. The .env is ignored by git, cause I have to practice not pushing my .env file to github ðŸ˜….

After having node installed and a database set up, run the following command in the project root to install all dependencies:
`npm install`

After all dependencies are done installing, use the following command to run the project:
`npm run start`

The project will run on http://localhost:3000/ you can change the port in the main.ts file.
